#ramsey, T1, rabi, npp, readout, echo, echo_1ax, amplitude
measurement: 'npp'

decimation: 1 #This parameter divides the sampling rate by this number.
#Then divides all the other parameters by this number as well.
#assuming decimation = 1 is with 1GS/s. each time unit is 1ns.
#for example, decimation = 2 will divide all the parameters by 2, set the sampling rate to 500MS/s.

readout_start: 1000
readout_duration: 20000
#pattern length for all measurements will be readout_start + readout_duration + total_wait_time

zero_length: 1000 #length of single wait time segment in ns. Minimum length of <~1000
zero_multiple: 2000 #how many times you want to repeat the zero segment

#total_wait_time is zero_length * zero_multiple. Time between end of readout to end of pattern

#For most measurements, to get exactly the number of patterns you want,
#(final_sweep_param - initial_sweep_param)/step_size should be an integer.
#otherwise there may be some remainder that gives one more or less pattern.

rabi_pulse_gap: 20 #samples between readout pulse and end of qubit pulse. Does NOT change between patterns
rabi_pulse_initial_duration: 0 #first duration of qubit pulse
rabi_pulse_end_duration: 800 #final duration of qubit pulse (should be larger than initial)

T1_init_gap: 20 #samples between beginning of readout pulse and initial T1 pulse
T1_final_gap: 800020 #samples between beginning of readout pulse and final T1 pulse
T1_q_dur: 150 #pulse width of qubit pulse. Does not change between patterns

ramsey_gap_2: 20 #unchanging gap between end of second qubit pulse and beginning of readout
ramsey_gap_1_init: 0 #initial gap between the two qubit pulses
ramsey_gap_1_final: 600000 #final gap between the two readout pulses
ramsey_q_dur: 65 #size of each individual pulse (i.e. pi/2 pulse)

echo_gap_2: 20 #gap between last qubit pulse and readout pulse. Does not change by pattern
echo_initial_t: 20 #inital t gap between first x pulse and y pulse. Or between y pulse and second x pulse
#initial should be smaller than final. Gap increases
echo_final_t: 1020 #final t gap
echo_pi_pulse: 140 #pi pulse used in y pulse and number/2 used in both x pulses

#This parameter used in all time domain measurements, step size in samples between each pattern

#sweep parameters are frequency ('wr', 'wq') in GHz, power of rf generators ('pr', 'pq') in DBm, and attenuator value ('q_att', 'r_att') in DB
#first letter is w for frequency p for power
#second letter is q for qubit RF generator and r for readout RF
#also p_twpa and w_twpa

#sweep params in GHz or db for attenuator
#If doing a single sweep, will look at p1, double will look at both
